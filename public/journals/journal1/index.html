          <h2>Author Information</h2>
          <p>Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935) was a Portuguese writer and poet, widely considered to be one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century. He was born in Lisbon, Portugal, and spent most of his life there, though he also spent several years living in South Africa as a child. Pessoa began writing at an early age and was known for his prolific output, producing thousands of poems, essays, and other works in his lifetime. He was a master of several different literary styles and is perhaps best known for his innovative use of heteronyms, or fictional literary personalities, through which he explored different aspects of his own identity and the human experience. Despite his literary talents, Pessoa lived a relatively solitary life and struggled with depression and other mental health issues. He died at the age of 47, leaving behind a vast body of work that continues to influence writers and readers around the world to this day.</p>

          <h2 >About This Article</h2>
          <p>This article presents the results of a study that investigates the effects of a new intervention program on academic achievement among middle school students. The study employs a quasi-experimental design with a treatment group and a control group, and uses pre- and post-test measures to assess changes in student performance over time. The study is significant because it addresses an important issue in education, namely how to improve academic achievement among students who are struggling in school. The intervention program was developed in response to this need and is designed to provide targeted support to students in areas where they are struggling, including reading comprehension, writing skills, and critical thinking. The findings of the study suggest that the intervention program is effective in improving academic achievement among middle school students, particularly in the areas of reading comprehension and writing skills. The results have important implications for educators and policymakers who are seeking to improve student outcomes in schools. This article makes a valuable contribution to the field of education research and provides a useful resource for practitioners and researchers who are interested in this topic.</p>
