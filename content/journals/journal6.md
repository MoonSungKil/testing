author_information: "Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935) was a Portuguese writer and poet, widely considered to be one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century. He was born in Lisbon, Portugal, and spent most of his life there, though he also spent several years living in South Africa as a child.
Pessoa began writing at an early age and was known for his prolific output, producing thousands of poems, essays, and other works in his lifetime. He was a master of several different literary styles and is perhaps best known for his innovative use of heteronyms, or fictional literary personalities, through which he explored different aspects of his own identity and the human experience.
Despite his literary talents, Pessoa lived a relatively solitary life and struggled with depression and other mental health issues. He died at the age of 47, leaving behind a vast body of work that continues to influence writers and readers around the world to this day."
